Full Moon Tileprops Format

A "*.tileprops" file corresponds to one image file, for 16x16-tile tilesheets.
It consists of multiple tables of 16x16 integers. (ie 16 lines each with 16 space-delimited integers).
Strict formatting, no comments, etc.

The first table goes into the real game.
These are the tile physics:
  0 vacant
  1 solid
  2 hole
  3 reserved
  
Subsequent tables are for the editor only:
  - neighbor mask
  - family
  - probability (inverse! 0=preferred, 254=very unlikely, 255=by appointment only)
