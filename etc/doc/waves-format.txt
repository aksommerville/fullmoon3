Format for cheapsynth waves source.

Line-oriented text file.
A wave chunk begins with a line: wave ID
ID is for validation only; they must be sequential from zero.

Within a wave chunk, each line is some operation to perform on the buffer.
The buffer is initially a sine wave.

sine
  Overwrite buffer with a sine wave.
  (redundant, this is the initial state anyway)
  
noise
  Overwrite buffer with random noise.
  This may be a different result every time, so probably not useful.
  I use it as kind of an "unused assertion", ensure if this wave gets used, I'll notice.
  
harmonics [COEFFICIENTS...]
  Play the current buffer at several harmonic frequencies and combine.
  COEFFICIENTS in 0..999.
  eg:
    harmonics 999 # no-op
    harmonics 0 # force silence
    harmonics 999 0 333 0 200 0 142 0 111 0 100 # approach square wave

normalize [LEVEL]
  Scale values such that the highest will be LEVEL (default 999).
  LEVEL in 0..999.
  I recommend ending every wave with this.

gain WHOLE FRACT [CLIP [GATE]]
  Scale values by a constant, then optionally clip high and low.
  (FRACT,CLIP,GATE) in 0..999, because I don't feel like parsing floats.
