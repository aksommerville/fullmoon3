Full Moon Song Format

This is for the "cheapsynth" synthesizer. Right now that's the only one I've made.
Future synthesizers might use a different format.

Like MIDI, our model is 16 channels, each of which can play 128 independent notes.
The channels are shared with the application (eg sound effects).
I recommend a convention that songs use channels 0..9, and the application 10..15.

For best efficiency, use the one-off "Note" command.
This can only use noteid 0x20..0x5f, 5 bits of velocity, and duration 0..63 ticks.
If you need longer sustain, notes at the far high or low end, or fine-grained velocity, use the MIDI-like Note On and Note Off commands.
In either case, we don't have concept of Off Velocity.

"Config" commands modify channel state with 8-bit key and value.
There is no concept of programs. The entire channel state is defined with Config commands.
  0x00 Reset all config for channel.
  0x01 Voice Type:
        0 Disable
        1 Square
        2 Wave table
        3 PCM
  0x02 waveid (VT 2)
  0x03 attack time, ms. (VT 1,2)
  0x04 attack level
  0x05 decay time, ms. (VT 1,2)
  0x06 sustain level
  0x07 release time, 8ms. (VT 1,2)
  0x08 max attack time
  0x09 max attack level
  0x0a max decay time
  0x0b max sustain level
  0x0c max release time
  
Envelope commands 0x03..0x07 set for both minimum and maxmimum velocity.
Their partners 0x08..0x0c set for maximum velocity only.
So set the minimums first, then the maximums if you want velocity articulation.

It is possible to reconfigure channels on the fly, but for now at least, I'm enforcing a convention that they be configured only at the start.
So, the "adjust" files declare channel config globally, and those commands go in the lead part, before the loop.
Control Change and Program Change from the MIDI files will be ignored.
We can revisit this decision later if it feels oppressive.

Song begins with a 4-byte header:
  u8 Tempo, ms/tick
  u8 Start position, in bytes from start of header (ie header length, ie 4)
  u16 Loop position, in bytes from start of header. Must be >= start position.
  
Followed by commands identifiable by their leading byte.

0000 0000                      : EOF
0ttt tttt                      : Delay (t) ticks.
100v vvvv  nnnn nndd  dddd cccc: Note: (v)elocity, (n)oteid, (d)uration, (c)hannel.
1010 cccc  kkkk kkkk  vvvv vvvv: Config: (c)hannel, (k)ey, (v)alue.
1011 cccc  0nnn nnnn  0vvv vvvv: Note On: (c)hannel, (n)oteid, (v)elocity.
1100 cccc  0nnn nnnn           : Note Off: (c)hannel, (n)oteid.
1101 xxxx: Reserved.
110x xxxx: Reserved.
111x xxxx: Reserved.

It is important that Note and Note On be the same length.

===== Adjustment Files =====

Each MIDI file may have a "*.adjust" file adjacent to it.
This is a text file describing actions to take during conversion.

Each line is processed individually, in order.
Tokens are delimited by whitespace. First token is the command.

debug [file|events|all]
  Dump diagnostics.

map [CRITERIA] => [CHANGES]
  Force the given changes on every event matching all CRITERIA.
  CRITERIA:
    track=INT
    chan=INT # NB 0-based, where MIDI is usually 1-based.
    opcode=INT
    note=INT # will only apply to Note On, Note Off, Note Adjust
  CHANGES:
    chan=INT
    opcode=INT # eg zero to neuter an event
    a=INT # first data byte
    b=INT # second data byte

end PAD
  Force end of song to the time of the last Note Off, padded out to a multiple of PAD qnotes.
  Zero is fine, that means end immediately at Note Off.
  Typical: "end 4"
  If unspecified, the song's length is based on the last event (even if you modify that event).

rate INT
  Force output rate in ms/tick 1..255.
  This bears on time quantization and file size, but not tempo.
  Probably you want to leave it automatic.

tempo INT
  Force input tempo, us/qnote.
  If unset, we read this from Meta Set Tempo, or default to 500000 (120 bpm).

mode CHID disable
mode CHID square
mode CHID voice WAVEID
mode CHID pcm
  Set mode for one channel. This will be established at the song's start.
  "pcm" mode currently doesn't do anything.
  
env CHID [lo] ATKTIME ATKLEVEL DECTIME SUSLEVEL RLSTIME
env CHID hi ATKTIME ATKLEVEL DECTIME SUSLEVEL RLSTIME
  Set envelope for one channel.
  "lo" and "hi" are minimum and maximum velocity, we interpolate between them.
  Times in ms, and levels in 0..0xffff
